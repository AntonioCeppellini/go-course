## Go Types

go has:

- bool (true/false)
- string ("something")
- int -> int, int8, int16, int32, int64 (positive or negative numbers: 8, -12 ecc).
- uint -> int8, uint16, uint32, uint64n uintptr (without sign, absolute)
- byte (aka uint8)
- rune (aka int32 and it represents a Unicode code point)
- float -> float32, float64
- complex -> complex64, complex128

number in the type (int*64*) is the room that a type has.
